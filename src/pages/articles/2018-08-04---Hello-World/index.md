So this is something that I've been putting off for far too long. Part of it was self-doubt, part of it was finding the time, and part of it was lack of focus.  But I'm starting this blog now.  I am going to do my best to be consistent with it.  

I think the catalyst was when a colleague messaged me on Slack telling me that they found an old blog of my on Firebase that I wrote for Hackbright and that it helped her solve a problem at her job.  I honestly didn't know that blog post was still live (especially since the Firebase API changed about a week after that blog was posted \*insert angry emoji\*).  That gave me the push I needed to do this.  In addition to documenting my knowledge, I might be able to help someone along the way.

So here I go.

Onward and Upward
